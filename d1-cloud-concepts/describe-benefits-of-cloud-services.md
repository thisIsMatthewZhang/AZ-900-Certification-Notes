# Describe the benefits of using cloud services

## Availability
- Encompasses availability of the infrastructure, applications, and services;  
- Generally expressed as a number of 9’s such as five nines or 99.999% availability.  
- Availability and uptime are often used interchangeably, but they are NOT the same;  
- Uptime simply measures the amount of time a system is running  
## Scalability
- The ability of a system to handle growth of users or work;  
- Refers to the ability of a system or service to handle more traffic (to scale) as scale increases  
## Elasticity
- The ability of a system to automatically grow and shrink based on app demand;  
- Focuses on the ability of a system or service to scale quickly to spikes in demand  
## Rapid Scalability and Elasticity
- Both allow the customer to grow or shrink the IT footprint as necessary to meet needs without excess capacity;  
## Agility
- Focuses on the speed and ease of allocating and deallocating resources;  
- This allows for vast amounts of computing resources to be provisioned in minutes;  
- Example: provisioning a scale set of 10 VMs  
## Fault Tolerance
- The ability of a system to handle faults in a service like power, network, or hardware failures;  
- Generally refers to component-level failures  
## High Availability
- The ability to keep services up and running for long periods of time;  
- Generally refers to service-level failures  
## Disaster Recovery
- The ability to recover from an event which has taken down a cloud service;  
- Generally focuses on recovery in the event of a service or site-level failure  
## Reliability
- The ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function;  
- Reliability consists of two principles: resiliency and availability:  
- Resiliency aims to return an application to a fully functioning state after a failure occurs;  
- The goal of availability is to provide consistent access to your application  
## Predictability
- Azure enables solutions with predictable cost and performance;  
- The level of service and performance and the associated cost are known in advance  

## Security
- Protection of customer data (access control, encryption);  
- Protection of cloud applications;  
- Protection of cloud infrastructure;  
- *IaaS gives customers more control versus PaaS and SaaS, but also places more security responsibility on the customer  

## Azure Distributed Denial of Services (DDoS)
- Standard tier provides enhanced DDoS mitigation features to defend against DDoS attacks;  
- Also includes logging, alerting, and telemetry not included in the free Basic tier present by default  

## Governance
- A set of rules and policies that guide an organization’s cloud operations;  
- To ensure data security, manage risk, control costs, and improve efficiency;  
- Cloud features are designed to support governance and compliance;  
- Deployment templates help ensure deployed resources meet corporate standards and regulatory requirements  

## Cloud Adoption Framework
- Guidance designed to help you create and implement the business and technology strategies to succeed in Azure;  
- Includes governance framework based on “Five disciplines of cloud governance”  

## Manageability (for the cloud)
There are two aspects of manageability for the cloud: WHAT and HOW;  
**1) Of the cloud (the WHAT)**  
- Automatically scale resource deployment based on need;  
- Deploy resources based on a preconfigured template;  
- Monitor the health of resources and automatically replace failing resources;  
- Receive automatic alerts based on configured metrics  
  
**2) In the cloud (the HOW)**  
- Speaks to how you're able to manage your cloud environment and resources:  
- Through a web portal  
- Using a command line interface  
- Using APIs
