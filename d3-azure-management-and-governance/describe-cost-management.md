# Describe cost management in Azure

## Cost Impacts
Factors that can affect Azure resource costs include resource **types, services, locations, ingress and egress traffic;**  

## Reducing Costs
Factors that can reduce costs include **reserved instances, reserved capacity, hybrid use benefit, spot pricing**  
- **Reserved instances:** reserve VMs in advance and save up to 72% compared to PAYG pricing with 1-yr or 3-yr commitment  
- **Reserved capacity:** achieve significant savings on Azure SQL Database, Azure Cosmos DB, and Azure Synapse Analytics and Azure Cache for Redis (discount is product-specific); Enables you to more easily manage costs across predictable and variable workloads and help optimize budgeting and forecasting (also includes a 1-yr and 3-yr option)  
- **Hybrid use benefit:** licensing benefit that helps you to significantly reduce the costs of running your workloads in the cloud; let’s you use your on-premises Software Assurance-enabled Windows Server and SQL Server licenses on Azure (Windows Server, SQL Server, Redhat, and Suse Linux)  
- **Spot pricing:** Access unused Azure compute capacity at deep discounts–tp to 90% compared to PAYG prices; use for workloads that can be interrupted without harm (applies to Azure VMs only)  

## Pricing Calculator
Interactive calculator that allows you to estimate the expected monthly Azure costs;  
Choose regions, services, options, and SKUs;  
BEFORE you deploy  

## TCO Calculator
A tool that helps **estimate cost savings** you can achieve by migrating application workloads to Azure;  
Allows you to compare the TCO of different Azure services and regions and provides a detailed breakdown of cost of components and potential savings;  
BEFORE you deploy  

## Azure Cost Management
A suite of tools provided by Microsoft that help you **analyze, manage, and optimize costs** of your workloads;  
AFTER you deploy  

## Tags
A **name and a value pair** used to logically organize Azure resources, resource groups, and subscriptions into a logical taxonomy;  
Tags can be the **basis for applying business policies or tracking costs;**  
You can also **enforce tagging rules** with Azure policies;  
**Examples of common tags** include owner, cost center, app/service, and environment
