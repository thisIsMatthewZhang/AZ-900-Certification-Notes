# Describe features and tools for managing and deploying Azure resources

## Azure Portal
Web-based, unified console where you can manage your Azure subscriptions using a GUI  

## Azure Cloud Shell
Interactive, authenticated, browser-accessible shell for managing Azure resources;  
Includes both Bash and PowerShell options  

## Azure CLI
Set of commands used to create and manage Azure resources;  

## Azure PowerShell
Set of cmdlets for managing Azure resources directly from the PowerShell command line;  
MSFT provides Azure-specific modules and cmdlets  

## Azure Mobile App
App for iOS and Android that enables managing, tracking health and status, and troubleshooting your Azure resources  

## Azure Arc
Platform that extends Azure services to run applications across datacenters, edge, and multi-cloud environments;  
Provides a consistent development, operations, and security model to run applications on new and existing hardware;  
Simplifies governance and management by delivering a consistent multi-cloud and on=premises management platform;  
Extends ARM capabilities to Linux and Windows servers, as well as Kubernetes clusters on any infrastructure across on-premises, multi-cloud, and the edge  

## Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
Management of infrastructure (networks, VMs, load balancers, and connection topology) described in code;  
Just as the same source code generates the same binary, code in the IaC model results in the same environment every time it is applied;  
IaC is a key DevOps practice and is used in conjunction with continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD)  

## Azure Resource Manager (ARM)
Deployment and management service for Azure;  
It provides a management layer that enables you to create, update, and delete resources i your Azure account  

## ARM Templates
JSON file that defines the infrastructure and configuration for your project;  
Templates use declarative syntax and are idempotent, which means you can deploy many times and get same resources and state;  
Used in deployment automation in infrastructure as code
